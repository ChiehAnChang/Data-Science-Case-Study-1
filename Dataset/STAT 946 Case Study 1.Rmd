# 1 Datasets

## 1.1 Air Pollutant Data

### 1.1.1 Ontario:

The Ontario Air Pollutant Data was obtained from the following URL: https://www.airqualityontario.com/history/index.php.  
It is published by the Government of Ontario. We restrict the downloaded data to only contain the particular pollutant that we care about, which is PM2.5.

Each row of the dataset represents an observation by a station with multiple dates from January to December, recorded day by day.  
For the columns, the following table demonstrates the meaning of each column.

| Feature name | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| Station ID | A unique identifier for the station where PM2.5 measurements were recorded. It is an integer object. |
| Pollutant | Here, it is always assigned to fine particulate matter for PM2.5 measurement. It is a redundant column where all rows have the same value and could be further removed. It is a string object. |
| Date | The date of the measurements in Ontario time. It is represented in the format YYYY-MM-DD. It should be a date object. |
| HXX | Measurement of PM2.5 from XX:00 to XX:59, where XX represents 01 to 24. The value 24 is an exception, where H24 corresponds to 00:00 to 00:59. It should be a datetime object. |

For this dataset, it is not difficult to obtain year-by-year data, as it is easy to download by year and each file contains all the dates for that year. However, if we want the full dataset from 2010 to 2024, further merging of the datasets is required.
