# Datasets

## Air Pollutant Data

### Ontario:

The Ontario Air Pollutant Data was obtained from the following URL: https://www.airqualityontario.com/history/index.php.  
It is published by the Government of Ontario [@Government_of_Ontario_Air_Quality_Historical_Data_2024].

Based on the disclaimer provided by the Government of Ontario, these data have not been verified. The data are provided only for public awareness. It is suggested that the usage of the data be restricted to non-published documents due to the unverified nature of the data. Since the data follow the copyright of the Open Government Licence – Ontario, a request is required for business usage (any profit-related or paid usage). Since this is academic usage, there is no need to submit a request, and there is no restriction on copying the data in this case.

Each row of the dataset represents an observation recorded by a station, with multiple dates from January to December, measured on a day-by-day basis.  
For the columns, the following table demonstrates the data type of each feature and the meaning of each column.

| Feature name | Type | Definition |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Station ID | Integer | A unique identifier for the station where PM2.5 measurements were recorded. |
| Pollutant | String | Here, it is always assigned to fine particulate matter for PM2.5 measurement. It is a redundant column, as all rows have the same value and could be removed. |
| Date | Date | The date of the measurements in Ontario time. It is represented in the format YYYY-MM-DD. |
| HXX | Datetime | Measurement of PM2.5 from XX:00 to XX:59, where XX represents values from 01 to 24. The value 24 is an exception, where H24 corresponds to 00:00 to 00:59. |

For this dataset, it is not difficult to obtain year-by-year data, as the data can be easily downloaded by year and each file contains all dates for that year. In this case, if we want to download data from 2010 to 2024, there will be 15 clicks to download all datasets for each year across different locations. However, if we want the full dataset from 2010 to 2024, further merging of the datasets is required.



\newpage

### British Columbia:
The British Columbia Air Pollutant Data was obtained from the following URL: https://www.airqualityontario.com/history/index.php.  
It is published by the Government of British Columbia [@Government_of_British_Columbia_Air_Quality_Station_Data_2024].

Based on the disclaimer provided by the Government of British Columbia, these data have not been verified. The data are provided only for public awareness. Since the data follow the copyright of the Open Government Licence – British Columbia, there is no need to further request permission for usage. However, there cannot be any implicit mention of terms that imply government support for the ideas without authorization.

Each row of the dataset represents an observation from a station with multiple dates from January to December, recorded day by day.  
For the columns, the following table demonstrates the meaning of each column.

| Feature name | Type | Definition |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Date | Date | The date of the measurements in British Columbia time, in the format **MM/DD/YYYY**. |
| Time | Integer | The time of the measurements in British Columbia time, represented as integers from **1 to 24**. There is no **0**. The end of a day is represented as **24:00**. |
| PM25 | Float | The PM2.5 concentration, measured in **µg/m³**. |

For this dataset, it is difficult to obtain year-by-year data, as it is required to download the data by year from each measurement station. There are more than 10 stations, and we hope to download data from 2010 to 2024, which could be 15 datasets for each station. This would lead to more than 150 required button clicks. It is suggested to use Python scraping

\newpage
### Alberta:
The Alberta Air Pollutant Data was obtained from the Alberta Data Management Platform[@Government_of_Alberta_Ambient_Air_Data_2026], available at:
https://datamanagementplatform.alberta.ca/Ambient

The data is operated and reported by community-based, multi-stakeholder organizations (commonly referred to as airsheds) as well as the Government of Alberta. These organizations are responsible for monitoring ambient air quality across Alberta and submitting station-level observations to the platform.

The data is subject to change at any time, as records may be further reviewed, corrected, or resubmitted by the reporting organizations. In addition, only data that has been officially submitted is available for download, and the displayed results depend on the selected search and filtering criteria.

Each row in the dataset represents a single observation from a monitoring station at a specific date and time for a given pollutant. Unlike the Ontario dataset, the Alberta data is stored in a vertical (long) format, where measurements for different parameters and timestamps are recorded as separate rows rather than as multiple hourly columns.
The dataset includes, but is not limited to, the following key variables:

| Feature name | Data type | Definition |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| Station ID | Integer | A unique identifier for the air monitoring station. |
| Station Name | String | The name of the air monitoring station. |
| Station Type | String | Classification of the monitoring station (e.g., ambient, mobile). |
| Station Status | String | Operational status of the station (e.g., active, inactive). |
| Station Latitude | Numeric | Latitude coordinate of the monitoring station location. |
| Station Longitude | Numeric | Longitude coordinate of the monitoring station location. |
| Collection Type | String | Indicates how the data was collected (e.g., continuous, discrete). |
| Time Code | String | Code describing the temporal resolution or reporting interval of the measurement. |
| Parameter | String | The air pollutant or environmental parameter being measured (e.g., PM2.5). |
| Method Name | String | The measurement or analytical method used to obtain the observation. |
| Interval Start | Datetime | The start date and time of the measurement interval. |
| Interval End | Datetime | The end date and time of the measurement interval. |
| Measurement Value | Numeric | The measured concentration or value of the parameter over the specified time interval. |
| Unit | String | The unit of measurement associated with the measurement value. |

From a technical perspective, collecting the Alberta data requires additional processing. Rather than downloading a single consolidated file, data must be retrieved station by station based on filtering criteria such as operator type and available parameters. To handle this efficiently and reproducibly, a Python-based web scraping program was used to automate the download process. The script iterates over all eligible stations, retrieves their corresponding datasets, and compiles a master table that serves as a directory of all stations meeting the project requirements.


\newpage
### Winnipeg, Manitoba:
The Winnipeg Air Quality Data was obtained from the City of Winnipeg Open Data Portal[@City_of_Winnipeg_Air_Quality_Data_2026]
, available at:
https://data.winnipeg.ca/Organizational-Support-Services/Air-Quality-deprecated-/f58p-2ju3/about_data

The dataset was published and maintained by the City of Winnipeg. The data records air quality measurements collected across Winnipeg, Manitoba, through a network of environmental sensors deployed throughout the city.

According to the data source, this dataset is currently marked as deprecated due to issues with the underlying data source, and it is no longer actively maintained. However, updates may resume in the future if a new data source is procured. Despite this designation, the dataset was last updated on November 26, 2025, and therefore remains valuable for historical analysis and recent trend exploration.

Each row in the dataset represents a single observation recorded at a specific location and time. Measurements are collected at 5-minute intervals, resulting in a large, high-frequency time-series dataset.
The dataset includes the following key variables:

| Feature name | Data type | Definition |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| ObservationID | Integer | A unique identifier for each recorded observation. |
| ObservationTime | Datetime | The date and time when the measurement was recorded (5-minute intervals). |
| ThingID | Integer | An identifier associated with the sensing device. |
| LocationName | String | The name of the monitoring location within Winnipeg. |
| MeasurementType | String | The type of environmental measurement (e.g., PM2.5, temperature, humidity). |
| MeasurementValue | Numeric | The recorded value of the measurement. |
| MeasurementUnit | String | The unit associated with the measurement value. |
| Location | String | Geographic coordinates of the monitoring station. |
| Point | Geometry | Spatial point representation of the station location. |

Data collection for Winnipeg is relatively straightforward. All records are integrated into a single, centralized table that can be downloaded directly from the data portal without the need for station-by-station retrieval or automated scraping.
